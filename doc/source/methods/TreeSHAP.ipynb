    "The algorithm provides human interpretable explanations suitable for regression and classification of models with tree structure applied to tabular data. This method is a member of the *additive feature attribution methods* class; feature attribution refers to the fact that the change of an outcome to be explained (e.g., a class probability in a classification problem) with respect to a *baseline* (e.g., average prediction probability for that class in the training set) can be attributed in different proportions to the model input features. \n",

    "A simple illustration of the explanation process is shown in Figure 1. Here we see depicted a tree-based model which takes as an input features such as `Age`, `BMI` or `Blood pressure` and outputs `Mortality risk score`, a continuous value. Lets assume that we aim to explain the difference between and observed outcome and no risk, corresponding to a base value of `0.0`. Using the Tree SHAP algorithm, we attribute the `4.0` difference to the input features. Because the sum of the attribute values equals `output - base value`, this method is _additive_. We can see for example that the `Sex` feature contributes negatively to this prediction whereas the remainder of the features have a positive contribution (i.e., increase the mortality risk). For explaining this particular data point, the `Blood Pressure` feature seems to have the largest effect, and corresponds to an increase in the mortality risk. See our example on how to perform explanations with this algorithm and visualise the results using the `shap` library visualisations [here](../examples/interventional_tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb) and [here](../examples/path_dependent_tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb)."

Hence, if the conditional expectation if used to estimate $f(S)$, the Shapley values might not be accurate since they also depend on the remaining variables, effect which becomes important if there are strong correlations amongst the independent variables. Furthermore, the authors show that estimating $f(S)$ using the conditional expectation violates the *sensitivity principle*, according to which the Shapley value of a redundant variable should be 0. On the other hand, the intervention breaks the dependencies, ensuring that the sensitivity holds. One potential drawback of this method is that setting a subset of values to certain values without regard to the values of the features in the complement (i.e., $\\bar{S}$) can generate instances that are outside the training data distribution, which will affect the model prediction and hence the contributions.\n",

Therefore, one defines the set $F$ in the previous section as $F = \\{ j: x_{j} \\neq r_{j}\\}$ for this case. Note that these are the only features for which one can estimate a contribution given this background sample; the same path is followed for features $F2$ and $F4$ for both the original and the perturbed sample, these features do not contribute to explain the difference between the observed outcome ($v_6$) and the outcome that would have been observed if the tree had been traversed according to the reference $(v_{10})$.\n",

These negative values are weighted according to the combinatorial factor in equation $(1)$.  By a similar reasoning, the nodes in the right subtree are reached only if $F1$ is present and they provide the postive terms for the shap value computation. Note that the combinatorial factor in $(1)$ should be evaluated with $|S| \\gets |S| - 1$ for positive contributions since $|S|$ is increased by $1$ because of the feature whose contribution is calculated is present in the right subtree. \n",

Thus, the interaction values can be computed in $O(TMLD^2)$ with the path-dependent perturbation algorithm and $O(TMLDR)$ with the interventional feature perturbation algorithm.\n"

    "Tree-based models are widely used in areas where model interpretability is of interest because node-level statistics gathered from the training data can be used to provide insights into the behaviour of the model across the training dataset, providing a _global explanation_ technique. As shown in our [example](/../../examples/tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb#xgboost_importance), considering different statistics gives rise to different importance rankings. As discussed in [[1]](#References) and [[3]](#References), depending on the statistic chosen, feature importances derived from trees are not *consistent*, meaning that a model where a feature is known to have a bigger impact might fail to have a larger importance. As such, feature importances cannot be compared across models.  In contrast, both the path-dependent and interventional perturbation algorithms tackle this limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to feature importances derived from tree statistics, the Tree SHAP algorithms can also provide local explanations, allowing the identification of features that are globally \"not important\", but can affect specific outcomes significantly, as might be the case in healthcare applications. Additionally, it provides a means to succinctly summarise the effect magnitude and direction (positive or negative) across potentially large samples. Finally, as shown in [[1]](#References) (see [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-019-0138-9/MediaObjects/42256_2019_138_MOESM1_ESM.pdf), p. 26),  averaging the instance-level shap values importance to derive a global score for each feature can result in improvements in feature selection tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another method to derive instance-level explanations for tree-based model has been proposed by Sabaas [here](https://github.com/andosa/treeinterpreter). This feature attribution method is similar in spirit to Shapley value, but does not account for the effect of variable order as explained [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-019-0138-9/MediaObjects/42256_2019_138_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) (pp. 10-11) as well as not satisfying consistency ([[3]](#References)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, both Tree SHAP algorithms exploit model structure to provide exact Shapley values computation albeit using different estimates for the effect of missing features, achieving explanations in low-order polynomial time. The KernelShap method relies on post-hoc (black-box) function modelling and approximations to approximate the same quantities and given enough samples has been shown to to the exact values (see experiments [here](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs42256-019-0138-9/MediaObjects/42256_2019_138_MOESM1_ESM.pdf) and our [example](/../../examples/tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb#xgboost_importance)). Our Kernel SHAP [documentation](KernelSHAP.ipynb) provides comparisons of feature attribution methods based on Shapley values with other algorithms such as LIME and [anchors](Anchors.ipynb). \n",
