    "\n",
    "Partial Dependence Variance is a method proposed by [Greenwell et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04755)[[1]](#References) to compute the global feature importance or the feature interaction of a pair of features. As the naming suggests, the feature importance and the feature interactions are summarized in a single positive number given by the variance within the [Partial Dependence (PD)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-29/issue-5/Greedy-function-approximation-A-gradient-boostingmachine/10.1214/aos/1013203451.full)[[2, 3]](#References) function. Because the computation relies on the `PD`, the method is quite intuitive and easy to comprehend.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better intuition of what the proposed method tries to achieve, let us consider a simple example. Given a trained model on the [Bike rental](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)[[4]](#References) dataset, one can compute the `PD` function for each individual feature. Figure 1 displays the `PD` for 6 out of 11 features:"

    "From the inspection of the plots, we can observe that temperature (temp), humidity (hum), wind speed (windspeed) have a strong non-linear relationship with the predicted outcome. We can observe that the model prediction increases with temperature till it reaches approx $17^{\\circ}C$. Then it flattens at a high number until the weather becomes too hot (i.e., approx. $27^{\\circ}C$ ), after which it starts dropping again. The humidity larger than $60\\%$ seems to be a factor that inhibits the number of rentals, since we can observe a downward trend form that point onward. Finally, a similar analysis can be conducted for speed. As the wind speed increases, fewer and fewer people are riding the bike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quite noticeable are the plots in the second row which show a flat response. Naturally, although some heterogeneity can be hidden, one can assume that the features in the second row have a less impact on the model prediction than the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the arguments above, one can propose a notion of quantifying the importance of a feature based on a measure of flatness of the `PD` function, for which the variance represents a natural and straightforward candidate. Figure 2 displays the global feature importance for the given example using the variance of the `PD` function (left figure) and a model-internal method (i.e., based on impurity because it is a tree ensemble model) (right figure):"

The intuition proposed by the authors is that a weak interaction effect between $X_i$ and $X_j$ on the response $Y$ would suggest that importance $i(X_i, X_j)$ has little variance when either $X_i$ or $X_j$ is held constant and the other varies.\n",

Following that, we take the standard deviation of the resulting importance scores across all values of $X_j$. We denote the latter quantity as $i(X_i | X_j)$. Similarly, we compute $i(X_j | X_i)$. To compute the feature interaction, one simply averages the two results. A large values will indicate a possible feature interaction."

Although this can be a valid function decomposition within an axiomatic framework, it is not the case for the `PD`.

In our case we can analyze the three terms:\n",

    "We now come back to [Greenwell et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04755)[[1]](#References) proposal on how to measure the feature interaction. For feature $X_1$, the first step is to compute the standard deviation of the `PD` along the $X_2$ axis when $X_1$ is held constant. This is equivalent of computing the root mean squared error (i.e., corresponds to the red lines above). This first step can quantify whether there is some effect we are missing just by using $X_1$, which we can attribute to either a fraction from the main effect of $X_2$ or to the interaction between $X_1$ and $X_2$ (we still do not know to which one we should attribute). We repeat the same step for every value of $X_1$. Having all the standard deviations for every value of $X_{1i}$ (i.e., $SD_{X_2}(X_2 | X_{1i})$, we compute the standard deviation along the $X_1$, $i(X_1 | X_2) = SD_{X_1}[SD_{X_2}(X_2 | X_{1})]$. This step is necessary (but not sufficient) to check whether the variance in the error is attributed to the fraction from the main effect of $X_2$ or to the feature interaction between $X_1$ and $X_2$.  Note that if the standard deviation $i(X_1 | X_2) = SD_{X_1}[SD(X_2 | X_1)] = 0$, it means that we have the same variance along the $X_2$ for every value $X_{1i}$. This might happen for multiple reasons, but one reason can be if we encounter the same error pattern when we condition on every $X_{1i}$. If that happens then it means that there is no feature interaction and all the error is attributed to a fraction of the main effect of $X_2$."
