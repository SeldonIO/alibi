    "Humans often think about how they can alter the outcome of a situation. *What do I need to change for the bank to approve my loan?* is a common example. This form of counterfactual reasoning comes natural to us and explains how to arrive at a desired outcome in an interpretable manner. Moreover, examples of counterfactual instances resulting in a different outcome can give powerful insights of what is important to the the underlying decision process. This makes it a compelling method to explain predictions of machine learning models. In the context of predictive models, a counterfactual instance describes the necessary change in input features of a test instance that alter the prediction to a predefined output (e.g. a prediction class). The counterfactual is found by iteratively perturbing the input features of the test instance during an optimization process until the desired output is achieved.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The perturbation $\\delta$ changing the original instance $x_{0}$ into $x_{cf} = x_{0} + \\delta$ should be sparse.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The counterfactual $x_{cf}$ should be interpretable. This implies that $x_{cf}$ needs to lie close to both the overall and counterfactual class specific data distribution.\n",

    "We can obtain those properties by incorporating additional loss terms in the objective function that is optimized using gradient descent. A basic loss function for a counterfactual can look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Loss$ = $cL_{pred}$ + $\\beta$$L_{1}$ + $L_{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first loss term, $cL_{pred}$, encourages the perturbed instance to predict another class than the original instance. The $\\beta$$L_{1}$ + $L_{2}$ terms act as an elastic net regularizer and introduce sparsity by penalizing the size of the difference between the counterfactual and the perturbed instance. While we can obtain sparse counterfactuals using this objective function, these are often not very interpretable because the training data distribution is not taken into account, and the perturbations are not necessarily meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Contrastive Explanation Method (CEM)](./CEM.ipynb) uses an [autoencoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) which is trained to reconstruct instances of the training set. We can then add the $L_{2}$ reconstruction error of the perturbed instance as a loss term to keep the counterfactual close to the training data distribution. The loss function becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Loss$ = $cL_{pred}$ + $\\beta$$L_{1}$ + $L_{2}$ + $L_{AE}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $L_{AE}$ does however not necessarily lead to interpretable solutions or speed up the counterfactual search. The lack of interpretability occurs because the overall data distribution is followed, but not the class specific one. That's where the prototype loss term $L_{proto}$ comes in. To define the prototype for each prediction class, we can use the encoder part of the previously mentioned autoencoder. We also need the training data or at least a representative sample. We use the model to make predictions on this data set. For each predicted class, we encode the instances belonging to that class. The class prototype is simply the average of the k closest encodings in that class to the encoding of the instance that we want to explain. When we want to generate a counterfactual, we first find the nearest prototype other than the one for the predicted class on the original instance. The $L_{proto}$ loss term tries to minimize the $L_{2}$ distance between the counterfactual and the nearest prototype. As a result, the perturbations are guided to the closest prototype, speeding up the counterfactual search and making the perturbations more meaningful as they move towards a typical in-distribution instance. If we do not have a trained encoder available, we can build class representations using [k-d trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) for each class. The prototype is then the *k* nearest instance from a k-d tree other than the tree which represents the predicted class on the original instance. The loss function now looks as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Loss$ = $cL_{pred}$ + $\\beta$$L_{1}$ + $L_{2}$ + $L_{AE}$ + $L_{proto}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The method allows us to select specific prototype classes to guide the counterfactual to. For example, in MNIST the closest prototype to a 9 could be a 4. However, we can specify that we want to move towards the 7 prototype and avoid 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to help interpretability, we can also add a trust score constraint on the proposed counterfactual. The trust score is defined as the ratio of the distance between the encoded counterfactual and the prototype of the class predicted on the original instance, and the distance between the encoded counterfactual and the prototype of the class predicted for the counterfactual instance. Intuitively, a high trust score implies that the counterfactual is far from the originally predicted class compared to the counterfactual class. For more info on trust scores, please check out the [documentation](./TrustScores.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the $L_{proto}$ term, we can actually remove the prediction loss term and still obtain an interpretable counterfactual. This is especially relevant for fully black box models. When we provide the counterfactual search method with a Keras or TensorFlow model, it is incorporated in the TensorFlow graph and evaluated using automatic differentiation. However, if we only have access to the model's prediction function, the gradient updates are numerical and typically require a large number of prediction calls because of $L_{pred}$. These prediction calls can slow the search down significantly and become a bottleneck. We can represent the gradient of the loss term as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*} \\frac{\\partial L_{pred}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial L_{pred}}{\\partial p} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ is the prediction function and $x$ the input features to optimize. For a 28 by 28 MNIST image, the $^{\\delta p}/_{\\delta x}$ term alone would require a prediction call with batch size 28x28x2 = 1568. By using the prototypes to guide the search however, we can remove the prediction loss term and only make a single prediction at the end of each gradient update to check whether the predicted class on the proposed counterfactual is different from the original class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Categorical Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial for many machine learning applications to deal with both continuous numerical and categorical data. Explanation methods which rely on perturbations or sampling of the input features need to make sure those perturbations are meaningful and capture the underlying structure of the data. If not done properly, the perturbed or sampled instances are possibly out of distribution compared to the training data and result in misleading explanations. The perturbation or sampling process becomes tricky for categorical features. For instance random perturbations across possible categories or enforcing a ranking between categories based on frequency of occurrence in the training data do not capture this structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our method first computes the pairwise distances between categories of a categorical variable based on either the model predictions (MVDM) or the context provided by the other variables in the dataset (ABDM). For MVDM, we use the difference between the conditional model prediction probabilities of each category. This method is based on the *Modified Value Difference Metric* (MVDM) by [Cost et al (1993)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022664626993). ABDM stands for *Association-Based Distance Metric*, a categorical distance measure introduced by [Le et al (2005)](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~bao/papers/N26.pdf). ABDM infers context from the presence of other variables in the data and computes a dissimilarity measure based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Both methods can also be combined as *ABDM-MVDM*. We can then apply multidimensional scaling to project the pairwise distances into Euclidean space. More details will be provided in a forthcoming paper.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides passing the predictive, and (optional) autoencoder and models, we set a number of **hyperparameters** …\n",
    "\n",
    "... **general**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `shape`: shape of the instance to be explained, starting with batch dimension. Currently only single explanations are supported, so the batch dimension should be equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `feature_range`: global or feature-wise min and max values for the perturbed instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `write_dir`: write directory for Tensorboard logging of the loss terms. It can be helpful when tuning the hyperparameters for your use case. It makes it easy to verify that e.g. not 1 loss term dominates the optimization, that the number of iterations is OK etc. You can access Tensorboard by running `tensorboard --logdir {write_dir}` in the terminal. The figure below for example shows the loss to be optimized over different $c$ iterations. It is clear that within each iteration, the number of `max_iterations` steps is too high and we can speed up the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "![cfplossopt](cfplossopt.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "... related to the **optimizer**:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* `clip`: min and max gradient values.\n",
    "\n",
    "... related to the **objective function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `c_init` and `c_steps`: the multiplier $c$ of the first loss term is updated for `c_steps` iterations, starting at `c_init`. The first loss term encourages the perturbed instance to be predicted as a different class than the original instance. If we find a candidate counterfactual for the current value of $c$, we reduce the value of $c$ for the next optimization cycle to put more emphasis on the other loss terms and improve the solution. If we cannot find a solution, $c$ is increased to put more weight on the prediction class restrictions of the counterfactual.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `kappa`: the first term in the loss function is defined by a difference between the predicted probabilities for the perturbed instance of the original class and the max of the other classes. $\\kappa \\geq 0$ defines a cap for this difference, limiting its impact on the overall loss to be optimized. Similar to CEM, we set $\\kappa$ to 0 in the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `beta`: $\\beta$ is the $L_{1}$ loss term multiplier. A higher value for $\\beta$ means more weight on the sparsity restrictions of the perturbations. $\\beta$ equal to 0.1 works well for the example datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `gamma`: multiplier for the optional $L_{2}$ reconstruction error. A higher value for $\\gamma$ means more emphasis on the reconstruction error penalty defined by the autoencoder. A value of 100 is reasonable for the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `theta`: multiplier for the $L_{proto}$ loss term. A higher $\\theta$ means more emphasis on the gradients guiding the counterfactual towards the nearest class prototype. A value of 100 worked well for the examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the dataset contains categorical variables, we need to additionally pass the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `cat_vars`: if the categorical variables have ordinal encodings, this is a dictionary with as keys the categorical columns and values the number of categories for the categorical variable in the dataset. If one-hot encoding is applied to the data, then the keys of the `cat_vars` dictionary represent the column where each categorical variable starts while the values still return the number of categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `ohe`: a flag (True or False) whether the categories are one-hot encoded.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to remember that the perturbations are applied in the numerical feature space, after the categorical variables have been transformed into numerical features. This has to be reflected by the dimension and values of `feature_range`. Imagine for example that we have a dataset with 10 columns. Two of the features are categorical and one-hot encoded. They can both take 3 values each. As a result, the number of columns in the dataset is reduced to 6 when we transform those categorical features to numerical features. As a result, the `feature_range` needs to contain the upper and lower ranges for 6 features. \n",
    "\n",
