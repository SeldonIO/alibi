    "The permutation importance, initially proposed by [Breiman (2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324)[[1]](#References), and further refined by [Fisher et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01489)[[2]](#References) is a method to compute the global importance of a feature for a tabular dataset. The computation of the feature importance is based on how much the model performance degrades when the feature values within a feature column are permuted. By inspecting the attribution received by each feature, a practitioner can understand which are the most important features that the model relies on to compute its predictions.\n",

Following that, we have three features that have approximately the same importance, namely the `average_montly_hours`, `last_evaluation` and `number_project`. Finally, in our top 5 hierarchy we have `time_spend_company`. Features like `sales`, `salary`, `Work_accident` and `promotion_last_5years` receive an importance close to 1 in the left plot and an importance close to 0 in the right plot which are an indication that the features are not important to the model.

The degradation of the model can thus be quantified as either the increase in the loss function or the decrease in the score function. Although one can transform a loss function into a score function an vice-versa (i.e., simply negate the value and optionally add an offset), the equivalent representation might not be always be natural to interpret (e.g., transforming mean squared error loss into the equivalent score given by the negative mean squared error).

For example, for a classification problem, the initialization of the score functions through strings can be done either `score_fns = ['accuracy', 'f1']` or directly `score_fns='f1'` when a single score function is used. Similarly, when a singe score function is used the initialization through a callable can be done as `score_fns = accuracy_score`, where `accuracy_score` is the reference to the function. Finally, the initialization through a dictionary would look like `score_fns={'name_score_1': function_score_1, 'name_score_2': function_score_2}`.

More precisely, consider a dataset with $M$ input features and a random forest classifier. After each tree is created, the values of the $m$-th feature in the [out-of-bag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-bag_error) (OOB) split are randomly permuted and the newly generated data is fed to the current tree to obtain a new prediction. The result for each newly generated data instance from OOB is saved. The process is then repeated for all features $m = 1, 2, ..., M$. After the procedure is completed for every tree, the noised responses are compared with the true label to give the misclassification rate. The importance of each feature is given by the percent increase in the misclassification rate as compared with the OOB rate when all the features are left intact. "

Besides the light computation, this approach can provide confidence intervals by computing the estimates over multiple data splits."

    "We end our theoretical exposition by mentioning that both estimators above can be used to compute an unbiased estimate of $\\hat{MR}(f)$. Furthermore, one interesting observation is that the definition of $e_{\\text{switch}}$ is very similar to the one proposed by [Breiman (2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324)[[1]](#References). Formally, the approach described by [Breiman (2001)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010933404324)[[1]](#References) can be written as:\n",

(2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01489)[[2]](#References) is proportional to the sum of losses over all $n!$ permutations, excluding the $n$ unique combinations of the rows of $X_1$ and the rows of $[Y, X_2]$ that appear in the original sample. As mentioned before, excluding those combinations is necessary to preserve the unbiasedness of the $\\hat{e}_{\\text{switch}}(f)$. "
