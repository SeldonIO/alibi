    "Machine learning models include in general linear and non-linear operations: neural networks may include several layers consisting of linear algebra operations followed by non-linear activation functions, while models based on decision trees are by nature highly non-linear. The linearity measure function and class provide an operational definition for the amount of non-linearity of a map acting on vector spaces. Roughly speaking, the amount of non-linearity of the map is defined based on how much the output of the map applied to a linear superposition of input vectors differs from the linear superposition of the map's outputs for each individual vector. In the context of supervised learning, this definition is immediately applicable to machine learning models, which are fundamentally maps from a input vector space (the feature space) to an output vector space that may represent probabilities (for classification models) or actual values of quantities of interest (for regression models).\n",

    "In supervised learning, a model can be considered as a function $M$  mapping vectors from the input space (feature vectors) to vectors in the output space. The output space may represents probabilities in the case of a classification model or values of the target quantities in the case of a regression model. The definition of the linearity measure given above can be applied to the case of a regression model (either a single target regression or a multi target regression) in a straightforward way.\n",

    "In the \"white box\" scenario, in which we have access to the internal architecture of the model,  the vector $z$ is accessible and the amount of non-linearity can be calculated immediately. On the other hand,  if the only accessible quantities are the output probabilities (the \"black box\" scenario), we need to invert the last layer's activation function in order to retrieve $z.$ In other words, that means defining a new map $M^\\prime = f^{-1} \\circ M(v)$ where $f$ is the activation function at the last layer and considering $L_{\\beta, \\alpha}^{(M^\\prime)}$ as a measure of the non-linearity of the model. The activation function of the last layer is usually a sigmoid function for binary classification tasks or a softmax function for multi-class classification. \n",

    "### Sampling\n",
    "The module implements two different methods for the sampling of vectors in a neighbourhood of the instance of interest $v.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first sampling method ```grid``` consists of defining the region $\\beta$ as a discrete lattice of a given size around the instance of interest, with the size defined in terms of the L1 distance in the lattice; the vectors are then sampled from the  lattice according to a uniform distribution. The density and the size of the lattice are controlled by the resolution parameter ```res``` and the size parameter ```epsilon```. This method is highly efficient and scalable from a computational point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second sampling method ```knn``` consists of sampling from the same probability distribution the instance $v$ was drawn from; this method is implemented by  simply selecting the $K$ nearest neighbours to $v$ from a training set, when this is available. The ```knn``` method imposes the constraint that the neighbourhood of $v$ must include only vectors from the training set, and as a consequence it will exclude out-of-distribution instances from the computation of linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pairwise vs global linearity\n",
    "The module implements two different methods to associate a value of the linearity measure to $v.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first method consists of measuring the ```global``` linearity in a region around $v.$ This means that we sample $N$ vectors $\\{v_i\\}$ from a region $\\beta$ of the input space around $v$ and apply\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "  L_{\\beta, \\alpha}^{(M)} = \\left\\| \\sum_{i=1}^N \\alpha_{i} M(v_i)  -\n",
    "  M\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^N \\alpha_i v_i \\right) \\right\\|,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second method consists of measuring the ```pairwise``` linearity between the instance of interest and other vectors close to it, averaging over all such pairs. In other words, we sample $N$ vectors $\\{v_i\\}$ from $\\beta$ as in the global method, but in this case we calculate the amount of  non-linearity $L_{(v,v_i),\\alpha}$ for every pair of vectors $(v, v_i)$ and average over all the pairs. Given two coefficients $\\{\\alpha_0, \\alpha_1\\}$ such that $\\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 = 1,$ we can define the pairwise linearity measure relative to the instance of interest $v$ as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\\label{pairwiselin}\n",
    "L^{(M)} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^N \\left\\|\\alpha_0 M(v) +  \\alpha_1 M(v_i) - M(\\alpha_0 v + \\alpha_1 v_i)\\right\\|.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The two methods are slightly different from a conceptual point of view: the global linearity measure combines all $N$ vectors sampled in $\\beta$ in a single superposition, and can be conceptually regarded as a direct approximation of the integral quantity. Thus, the quantity is strongly linked to the model behavior in the whole region $\\beta.$ On the other hand, the pairwise linearity measure is an averaged quantity over pairs of superimposed vectors, with the instance of interest $v$ included in each pair. For that reason, it is conceptually more tied to the instance $v$ itself rather than the region $\\beta$ around it. "
