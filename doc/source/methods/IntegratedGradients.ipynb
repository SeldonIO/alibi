    "Integrated gradients is a method originally proposed in Sundararajan et al., [\"Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365) that aims to attribute an importance value to each input feature of a machine learning model based on the gradients of the model output with respect to the input. In particular, integrated gradients defines an attribution value for each feature by considering the integral of the gradients taken along a straight path from a baseline instance $x^\\prime$ to the input instance $x.$"

In the case of a non-scalar output, such as in classification models or multi-target regression, the gradients are calculated for one given element of the output. For classification models, the gradient usually refers to the output corresponding to the true class or to the class predicted by the model.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Implementation invariance axiom: an attribution method should be such that the attributions do not depend on the particular implementation of the model.\n",
    "\n",
