# Contributing Code

We welcome PRs from the community. This document outlines the standard
practices and development tools we use.

When you contribute code, you affirm that the contribution is your original work and that you license the work to the project under the project's open source license. Whether or not you state this explicitly, by submitting any copyrighted material via pull request, email, or other means you agree to license the material under the project's open source license and warrant that you have the legal authority to do so.

## Getting started
The easiest way to get started is to install all the development dependencies
in a separate virtual environment:
```
pip install -r requirements/requirements_all.txt
```
This will install everything needed to run alibi and all the dev tools
(docs builder, testing, linting etc.)

## Git pre-commit hooks
To make it easier to format code locally before submitting a PR, we provide
integration with `pre-commit` to run `flake8`, `mypy` and `pyupgrade` (via `nbqa`) hooks before every commit.
After installing the development requirements and cloning the package, run `pre-commit install`
from the project root to install the hooks locally. Now before every `git commit ...`
these hooks will be run to verify that the linting and type checking is correct. If there are
errors, the commit will fail and you will see the changes that need to be made.

## Testing
We use `pytest` to run tests. To run all tests just call `pytest` from the root of the project.
Test files live together with the library files under `tests` folders.

Some tests use pre-trained models to test method convergence. These models and the dataset loading
functions used to train them live in the https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-testing repo which is
one of the requirements for running the test suite.

## Linter
We use `flake8` for linting adhering to PEP8 with exceptions defined in `setup.cfg`.

## Syntax
We use `pyupgrade` (run via `nbqa`) to ensure that the Jupyter notebooks in the documentation make use of syntax from
Python 3.6 onwards.

## Type checking
We use type hints to develop the libary and `mypy` to for static type checking. Some
options are defined in `setup.cfg`.

## Docstrings
We adhere to the `numpy` style docstrings (https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
with the exception of ommiting argument types in docstrings in favour of type hints in function
and class signatures. If you're using a `PyCharm`, you can configure this under
`File -> Settings -> Tools -> Python Integrated Tools -> Docstrings`.

## Building documentation
We use `sphinx` for building documentation. You can call `make build_docs` from the project root,
the docs will be built under `doc/_build/html`. Detail information about documentation can be found [here](doc/README.md).

## CI
All PRs triger a CI job to run linting, type checking, tests, and build docs.
