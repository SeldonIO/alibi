    "The tree SHAP (**SH**apley **A**dditive ex**P**lanations) algorithm is based on the paper [From local explanations to global understanding with explainable AI for trees](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0138-9) by Lundberg et al. and builds on the open source  [shap library](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) from the paper's first author.\n",

    "The algorithm provides human interpretable explanations suitable for regression and classification of models with tree structure applied to tabular data. This method is a member of the *additive feature attribution methods* class; feature attribution refers to the fact that the change of an outcome to be explained (e.g., a class probability in a classification problem) with respect to a *baseline* (e.g., average prediction probability for that class in the training set) can be attributed in different proportions to the model input features. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple illustration of the explanation process is shown in Figure 1. Here we see depicted a tree-based model which takes as an input features such as `Age`, `BMI` or `Blood pressure` and outputs `Mortality risk score`, a continuous value. Let's assume that we aim to explain the difference between and observed outcome and no risk, corresponding to a base value of `0.0`. Using the Tree SHAP algorithm, we attribute the `4.0` difference to the input features. Because the sum of the attribute values equals `output - base value`, this method is _additive_. We can see for example that the `Sex` feature contributes negatively to this prediction whereas the remainder of the features have a positive contribution (i.e., increase the mortality risk). For explaining this particular data point, the `Blood Pressure` feature seems to have the largest effect, and corresponds to an increase in the mortality risk. See our example on how to perform explanations with this algorithm and visualise the results using the `shap` library visualisations [here](../examples/interventional_tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb) and [here](../examples/path_dependent_tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb)."

    "In order to compute the shap values , the following arguments can optionally be set when calling the `explain` method:\n",

    "- `interactions`: set to `True` to decompose the shap value of every feature for every example into a main effect and interaction effects \n",

    "- `check_additivity`: if the explainer is initialised with `model_output = raw` and this option is `True` the explainer checks that the sum of the shap values is equal to model output - expected value\n",

    "- `cat_vars_enc_dim`: a list containing the dimension of the encoded categorical variables. The number of columns specified in this list is summed for each categorical variable starting with the corresponding index in `cat_var_start_idx`. So if `cat_var_start_idx=[0, 10]` and `cat_vars_enc_dim=[3, 5]`, then the columns with indices `0, 1` and `2` and `10, 11, 12, 13` and `14` will be combined to return one shap value for each categorical variable, as opposed to `3` and `5`.\n"

Hence, if the conditional expectation if used to estimate $f(S)$, the Shapley values might not be accurate since they also depend on the remaining variables, effect which becomes important if there are strong correlations amongst the independent variables. Furthermore, the authors show that estimating $f(S)$ using the conditional expectation violates the *sensitivity principle*, according to which the Shapley value of a redundant variable should be 0. On the other hand, the intervention breaks the dependencies, ensuring that the sensitivity holds. One potential drawback of this method is that setting a subset of values to certain values without regard to the values of the features in the complement (i.e., $\\bar{S}$) can generate instances that are outside the training data distribution, which will affect the model prediction and hence the contributions.\n",

This process gives the name of the algorithm since following the paths indicated by the background sample is akin to intervening on the instance to be explained with features from the background sample. Therefore, one defines the set $F$ in the previous section as $F = \\{ j: x_{j} \\neq r_{j}\\}$ for this case. Note that these are the only features for which one can estimate a contribution given this background sample; the same path is followed for features $F2$ and $F4$ for both the original and the perturbed sample, so these features do not contribute to explain the difference between the observed outcome ($v_6$) and the outcome that would have been observed if the tree had been traversed according to the reference $(v_{10})$.\n",

Because $F2$ and $F4$ do not contribute to explaining $f(x) - f(r)$, the negative contribution of the left subtree will be equal to the negative contribution of node $8$.

These negative values are weighted according to the combinatorial factor in equation $(1)$.  By a similar reasoning, the nodes in the right subtree are reached only if $F1$ is present and they provide the positive terms for the shap value computation. Note that the combinatorial factor in $(1)$ should be evaluated with $|S| \\gets |S| - 1$ for positive contributions since $|S|$ is increased by $1$ because of the feature whose contribution is calculated is present in the right subtree. \n",

As shown in our [example](../examples/path_dependent_tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb), considering different statistics gives rise to different importance rankings. As discussed in [[1]](#References) and [[3]](#References), depending on the statistic chosen, feature importances derived from trees are not *consistent*, meaning that a model where a feature is known to have a bigger impact might fail to have a larger importance. As such, feature importances cannot be compared across models.  In contrast, both the path-dependent and interventional perturbation algorithms tackle this limitation.\n",
