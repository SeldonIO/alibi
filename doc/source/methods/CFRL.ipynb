    "The counterfactual with reinforcement learning is based on the [Model-agnostic and Scalable Counterfactual Explanations via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02597.pdf) which proposes a fast, model agnostic method to generate batches of counterfactual explanations by replacing the usual optimization procedure with a learnable process. The method **does not** assume model differentiability, relies only on the feedback from the model predictions, allows for target-conditional counterfactual instances and flexible feature range constraints for numerical and categorical features, including the immutability of protected features (e.g, *gender*, *race*). Furthermore, it is easily extendable to multiple data modalities (e.g., images, tabular data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Counterfactual instances (a.k.a. counterfactual explanations, counterfactuals) are a powerful tool to obtain insight into the underlying decision process exhibited by a black-box model, describing the necessary minimal changes in the input space to alter the prediction towards the desired target. To be of practical use, a counterfactual should be sparse—close (using some distance measure) to the original instance—and indistinguishable from real instances, that is, it should be in-distribution. Thus, for a loan application system that currently outputs a rejection for a given individual, a counterfactual explanation should suggest plausible minimal changes in the feature values that the applicant could perform to get the loan accepted leading to actionable recourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "A desirable property of a method for generating counterfactuals is to allow feature conditioning. Real-world datasets usually include immutable features such as *gender* or *race*, which should remain unchanged throughout the counterfactual search procedure. A natural extension of immutability is to restrict a feature to a subset or an interval of values. Thus, following the same loan application example, a customer might be willing to improve their education level from a *High-school graduate* to *Bachelor’s* or *Master’s*, but not further. Similarly, a numerical feature such as *age* should only increase for a counterfactual to be actionable. To enable such feature conditioning, we propose to use a conditioning vector to guide the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A counterfactual explanation of a given instance represents a sparse, in-distribution example that alters the model prediction towards a specified target. Let $x$ be the original instance, $M$ a black-box model, $y_M = M(x)$ the model prediction on $x$ and $y_T$ the target prediction. The goal is to produce a counterfactual instance $x_{CF} = x + \\delta_{CF}$ where $\\delta_{CF}$ represents a sparse perturbation vector such that $y_T = M(x_{CF})$. Instead of solving an optimization problem for each input instance, we train a generative model which models the counterfactual instances $x_{CF}$ directly and allows for feature level constraints via an optional conditioning vector $c$. A conditional counterfactual explanation $x_{CF}$ therefore depends on the tuple $s = (x, y_M, y_T, c)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method **does not** assume the model $M$ to be differentiable and it trains the counterfactual generator using reinforcement learning, namely [Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971). DDPG interleaves a state-action function approximator called critic ($Q$), with learning an approximator called actor($\\mu$) to predict the optimal action, which is equivalent to predicting the optimal counterfactual. The method assumes that the critic is differentiable with respect to the action argument, thus allowing to optimize the actor's parameters efficiently through gradient-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model-agnostic training pipeline is compatible with various data modalities and only uses sparse model prediction feedback as a reward. For a classification model returning the predicted class label the reward can be defined by an indicator function, $R = 1(M(x_{CF}) = y_{T})$. The reward for a regression model, on the other hand is proportional to the proximity of $M(x_{CF})$ to the regression target $y_T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of directly modeling the perturbation vector $\\delta_{CF}$ in the potentially high-dimensional input space, we first train an [autoencoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder). The weights of the autoencoder are frozen and $\\mu$ applies the counterfactual perturbations in the latent space of the encoder. The pre-trained decoder maps the counterfactual embedding back to the input feature space. Since $\\mu$ operates in the continuous latent space we use the sample efficient DDPG method. We denote by $enc$ and $dec$ the encoder and the decoder networks, respectively. Given the encoded representation of the input instance $z = enc(x)$, the model prediction $y_M$, the target prediction $y_T$ and the conditioning vector $c$, the actor outputs the counterfactual’s latent representation $z_{CF} = \\mu(z, y_M, y_T, c)$. The decoder then projects the embedding $z_{CF}$ back to the original input space, followed by optional post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training step consists of simultaneously optimizing the actor and critic networks. The critic regresses on the reward $R$ determined by the model prediction, while the actor maximizes the critic’s output for the given instance through $L_{max}$. The actor also minimizes two objectives to encourage the generation of sparse, in-distribution counterfactuals. The sparsity loss $L_{sparsity}$ operates on the decoded counterfactual $x_{CF}$ and combines the $L_1$ loss over the standardized numerical features and the $L_0$ loss over the categorical ones. The consistency loss $L_{consist}$ aims to encode the counterfactual $x_{CF}$ back to the same latent representation where it was decoded from and helps to produce in-distribution counterfactual instances. Formally, the actor's loss can be written as:  $L_{actor} = L_{max} + \\lambda_{1}L_{sparsity} + \\lambda_{2}L_{consistency}$"

    "In many real-world applications, some of the input features are immutable, have restricted feature ranges, or are constrained to a subset of all possible feature values. These constraints need to be taken into account when generating actionable counterfactual instances. For instance, *age* and *marital status* could be features in the loan application example. An actionable counterfactual should however only be able to increase the numerical *age* feature and keep the categorical *marital status* feature unchanged. To achieve this we condition the counterfactual generator on a conditioning vector $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the decoding phase, as part of post-processing (denoted by a function $pp$), the numerical values are clipped within the desired range, and categorical values are conditionally sampled according to their masking vector. This step ensures that the generated counterfactual respects the desired feature conditioning before passing it to the model. Note that CFRL is flexible and allows non-differentiable post-processing such as casting features to their original data types (e.g., converting a decoded floating-point *age* to an integer: 40 = int(40.3)) and categorical mapping (e.g., *marital status* distribution/one-hot encoding to the married value) since we rely solely on the sparse model prediction reward."

To increase the diversity, we can sample the conditional vector subject to the user-defined feature constraints.
