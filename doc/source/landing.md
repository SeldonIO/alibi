# Alibi

[Alibi](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) is a open source Python library aimed at machine learning
model inspection and interpretation. The initial focus on the library is on black-box, instance
based model explanations.

## Goals
* Provide high quality reference implementations of black-box ML model explanation algorithms
* Define a consistent API for interpretable ML methods
* Support multiple use cases (e.g. tabular, text and image data classification, regression)
* Implement the latest model explanation, concept drift and other ML model monitoring and
  interpretation methods
