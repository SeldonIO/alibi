    "The anchor algorithm is based on the [Anchors: High-Precision Model-Agnostic Explanations](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/aaai18.pdf) paper by Ribeiro et al. and builds on the open source [code](https://github.com/marcotcr/anchor) from the paper's first author.\n",

    "The algorithm provides model-agnostic (*black box*) and human interpretable explanations suitable for classification models applied to images, text and tabular data. The idea behind anchors is to explain the behaviour of complex models with high-precision rules called *anchors*. These anchors are locally sufficient conditions to ensure a certain prediction with a high degree of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchors address a key shortcoming of local explanation methods like [LIME](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04938) which proxy the local behaviour of the model in a linear way. It is however unclear to what extent the explanation holds up in the region around the instance to be explained, since both the model and data can exhibit non-linear behaviour in the neighborhood of the instance. This approach can easily lead to overconfidence in the explanation and misleading conclusions on unseen but similar instances. The anchor algorithm tackles this issue by incorporating coverage, the region where the explanation applies, into the optimization problem. A simple example from sentiment classification illustrates this (Figure 1). Dependent on the sentence, the occurrence of the word *not* is interpreted as positive or negative for the sentiment by LIME. It is clear that the explanation using *not* is very local. Anchors however aim to maximize the coverage, and require *not* to occur together with *good* or *bad* to ensure respectively negative or positive sentiment.\n",

    "As highlighted by the above example, an anchor explanation consists of *if-then rules*, called the anchors, which sufficiently guarantee the explanation locally and try to maximize the area for which the explanation holds. This means that as long as the anchor holds, the prediction should remain the same regardless of the values of the features not present in the anchor. Going back to the sentiment example: as long as *not good* is present, the sentiment is negative, regardless of the other words in the movie review."

    "Anchors are also suitable for tabular data with both categorical and continuous features. The continuous features are discretized into quantiles (e.g. deciles), so they become more interpretable. The features in a candidate anchor are kept constant (same category or bin for discretized features) while we sample the other features from a training set. As a result, anchors for tabular data need access to training data. Let's illustrate this with an example. Say we want to predict whether a person makes less or more than £50,000 per year based on the person's characteristics including age (continuous variable) and marital status (categorical variable). The following would then be a potential anchor: Hugo makes more than £50,000 because he is married and his age is between 35 and 45 years."
