# Documentation for alibi

This directory contains the sources (`.md` and `.rst` files) for the
documentation. The main index page is defined in `source/index.rst`.
The Sphinx options and plugins are found in the `source/conf.py` file.
The documentation is generated in full by calling `make html` which
also automatically generates the Python API documentation from
docstrings.
