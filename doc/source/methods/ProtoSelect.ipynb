    "[Bien and Tibshirani (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5933) proposed ProtoSelect, which is a prototype selection method with the goal of constructing not only a condensed view of a dataset but also an interpretable model (applicable to classification only). Prototypes can be defined as instances that are representative of the entire training data distribution. Formally, consider a dataset of training points $\\mathcal{X} = \\{x_1, ..., x_n \\} \\subset \\mathbf{R}^p$ and their corresponding labels $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{y_1, ..., y_n\\}$, where $y_i \\in \\{1, 2, ..., L\\}$. ProtoSelect finds sets $\\mathcal{P}_{l} \\subseteq \\mathcal{X}$ for each class $l$ such that the set union of $\\mathcal{P}_1, \\mathcal{P}_2, ..., \\mathcal{P}_L$ would provided a distilled view of the training dataset $(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{Y})$.\n",

    "Because the integer program defined above cannot be solved in polynomial time, the authors propose two alternative solution.

We refer the reader to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5933) for more details. The second one, recommended and implemented in *Alibi*, follows a greedy approach. Given the current choice of prototypes subsets $(\\mathcal{P}_1, ..., \\mathcal{P}_L)$, in the next iteration we update it to $(\\mathcal{P}_1, ..., \\mathcal{P}_{l} \\cup \\{x_j\\}, ..., \\mathcal{P}_L)$, where $x_j$ is selected such that it maximizes the objective $\\Delta Obj(x_j, l) = \\Delta \\xi(x_j,l) - \\Delta\\nu(x_j, l) - \\lambda$, where:\n",

On the other hand, $\\Delta \\nu(x_j, l)$ counts how many instances belonging to a different class than $l$ the $x_j$ element covers. Finally, $\\lambda$ is the penalty/cost of adding a new prototypes encouraging sparsity (lower number of prototypes). Intuitively, a good prototype for a class $l$ will cover as many new instances belonging to class $l$ (i.e. maximize $\\Delta \\xi(x_j, l)$) and avoid covering elements outside the class $l$ (i.e. minimize $\\Delta \\nu(x_j, l)$). The prototype selection algorithm stops when all $\\Delta Obj(x_j, l)$ are lower than 0."

In this scenario, the dataset to be summarised is still $X$, but it is summarised by prototypes belonging to the dataset $Z$. Furthermore, note that we only need to specify the labels for the $X$ set through $y$, but not for $Z$. In case the labels $y$ are missing, the method implicitly assumes that all the instances belong to the same class. This means that the second term in the objective, $\\Delta\\nu(x_j, l)$, will be 0.
