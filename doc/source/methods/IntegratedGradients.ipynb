    "Integrated gradients is a method originally proposed in Sundararajan et al., [\"Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365) that aims to attribute an importance value to each input feature of a machine learning model based on the gradients of the model's output with respect to the input. In particular, integrated gradients defines an attribution value for each feature by considering the integral of the gradients taken along a straight path from a baseline instance $x^\\prime$ to the input instance $x.$"
