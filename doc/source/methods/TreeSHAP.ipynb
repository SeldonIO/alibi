    "The tree SHAP (**SH**apley **A**dditive ex**P**lanations) algorithm is based on the paper [From local explanations to global understanding with explainable AI for trees](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-019-0138-9) by Lundberg et al. and builds on the open source  [shap library](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) from the paper's first author.\n",

    "The algorithm provides human interpretable explanations suitable for regression and classification of models with tree structure applied to tabular data. This method is a member of the *additive feature attribution methods* class; feature attribution refers to the fact that the change of an outcome to be explained (e.g., a class probability in a classification problem) with respect to a *baseline* (e.g., average prediction probability for that class in the training set) can be attributed in different proportions to the model input features. \n",

    "A simple illustration of the explanation process is shown in Figure 1. Here we see depicted a tree-based model which takes as an input features such as `Age`, `BMI` or `Blood pressure` and outputs `Mortality risk score`, a contiuous value. Lets assume that we aim to explain the difference between and observed outcome and no risk, corresponding to a base value of `0.0`. Using the Tree SHAP algorithm, we attribute the `4.0` difference to the input features. Because the sum of the attribute values equals `output - base value`, this method is _additive_. We can see for example that the `Sex` feature contributes negatively to this prediction whereas the remainder of the features have a positive contribution (i.e., increase the mortality risk). For explaining this particular data point, the `Blood Pressure` feature seems to have the largest effect, and corresponds to an increase in the mortality risk. See our example on how to perform explanations with this algorithm and visualise the results using the `shap` library visualisations [here](../examples/tree_shap_adult_xgb.ipynb)."

Hence, if the conditional expectation if used to estimate $f(S)$, the Shapley values might not be accurate since they also depend on the remaining variables, effect which becomes important if there are strong correlations amongst the independent variables. Furthermore, the authors show that estimating $f(S)$ using the conditional expectation violates the *sensitivity principle*, according to which the Shapley value of a redundant variable should be 0. On the other hand, the intervention breaks the dependencies, ensuring that the sensitivity holds. One potential drawback of this method is that setting a subset of values to certain values without regard to the values of the features in the complement (i.e., $\\bar{S}$) can generate instances that are outside the training data distribution, which will affect the model prediction and hence the contributions.\n",

    "An instance to be explained $x$ is perturbed using a reference sample $r$ by the values of the features $F1$, $F3$ and $F5$ in $x$ with the corresponding values in $r$. Therefore, one defines the set $F$ in the previous section as $F = \\{ j: x_{j} \\neq r_{j}\\}$ for this case. Note that these are the only features for which one can estimate a contribution here; the same path is followed for features $F2$ and $F4$for both the original and the perturbed sample, these features do not contribute to explain the difference between the observed outcome ($v_6$) and the outcome that would have been observed if the tree had been traversed according to the reference $(v_{10})$.\n",

    "First one notices that the contribution of a feature at a node depends on the contribution of the features associated to the descendants of the node along a decision path. Therefore, if a contribution is assigned to each leave, one can aggregate those at internal nodes to obtain the contribution associated with each feature associated with an internal node. The algorithm terminates after the aggregation at the root is computed.\n",

    "Note that each leaf, as well as internal node, will have a both a positive and a negative contribution, marked in <span style=\"color:green\">green</span> and <span style=\"color:red\">red</span>, respectively, on the diagram below. To understand why, consider the subtree with the root at node $8$. To estimate the contribution of $F5$, one considers a set $S = \\varnothing$ and observes the value of node $10$, and weights that with the combinatorial factor from equation  $(1)$ where <sup>[(1)](#Footnotes) </sup> $M-1 = 1$ and $|S|=0$ and a positive contribution from node $9$. To compute the contributions of the upstream features correctly, one has to bear in mind that, for example, one needs to consider the term $-f(S={F5})$ when computing the contribution of $F1$. Hence, node $9$ will pass to its parents an additional negative contribution computed for $M-1 = 1$ and $|S|=1$. The positive and negative contributions of an internal node are computed by summing the corresponding nodes of the children nodes.     \n",
    "\n",

    "Thus, to compute the attribution for feature $F1$, the  summation over $-f(S)$ can be obtained from the left subtree whereas the summation over $f(S \\cup \\{1\\})$ can be computed from the right sub-tree, since the semantics of visiting node $1$ after node $0$ is that the feature $1$ is missing (i.e., is not in $S$). The negative contribution will contain a negative component obtained by considering feature $F5$ in isolation (given by node $10$), and a component that arises due to the need to take into consideration feature $F1$, in isolation. Thus, the negative contribution of node $1$ represents the negative terms in the summation in equation $(1)$, and the summation is over the elements of $\\{\\{F5\\}\\ , \\varnothing\\}$. A similar reasoning for the right-subtree allows to calculate the positive terms in the summation.\n",
