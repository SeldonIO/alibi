    "The *Contrastive Explanation Method* (CEM) is based on the paper [Explanations based on the Missing: Towards Constrastive Explanations with Pertinent Negatives](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07623) and extends the [code](https://github.com/IBM/Contrastive-Explanation-Method) open sourced by the authors. CEM generates instance based local black box explanations for classification models in terms of Pertinent Positives (PP) and Pertinent Negatives (PN). For a PP, the method finds the features that should be minimally and sufficiently present (e.g. important pixels in an image) to predict the same class as on the original instance. PN's on the other hand identify what features should be minimally and necessarily absent from the instance to be explained in order to maintain the original prediction class. The aim of PN's is not to provide a full set of characteristics that should be absent in the explained instance, but to provide a minimal set that differentiates it from the closest different class. Intuitively, the Pertinent Positives could be compared to Anchors while Pertinent Negatives are similar to Counterfactuals. As the authors of the paper state, CEM can generate clear explanations of the form: \"An input x is classified in class y because features $f_{i}$, ..., $f_{k}$ are present and because features $f_{m}$, ..., $f_{p}$ are absent.\" The current implementation is most suitable for images and tabular data without categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create interpretable PP's and PN's, feature-wise perturbation needs to be done in a meaningful way. To keep the perturbations sparse and close to the original instance, the objective function contains an elastic net ($\\beta$$L_{1}$ + $L_{2}$) regularizer. Optionally, an auto-encoder can be trained to reconstruct instances of the training set. We can then introduce the $L_{2}$ reconstruction error of the perturbed instance as an additional loss term in our objective function. As a result, the perturbed instance lies close to the training data manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to add or remove features to arrive at respectively PN's or PP's implies that there are feature values that contain no information with regards to the model's predictions. Consider for instance the MNIST image below where the pixels are scaled between 0 and 1. The pixels with values close to 1 define the number in the image while the background pixels have value 0. We assume that perturbations towards the background value 0 are equivalent to removing features, while perturbations towards 1 imply adding features."

For models built in different frameworks (e.g. scikit-learn), the gradients of part of the loss function with respect to the input features need to be evaluated numerically.

If we find a candidate PN or PP for the current value of $c$, we reduce the value of $c$ for the next optimization cycle to put more emphasis on the regularization terms and improve the solution.
