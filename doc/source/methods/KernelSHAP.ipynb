    "The Kernel SHAP (**SH**apley **A**dditive ex**P**lanations) algorithm is based on the paper [A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions) by Lundberg et al. and builds on the open source  [shap library](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) from the paper's first author.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm provides model-agnostic (*black box*), human interpretable explanations suitable for regression and classification models applied to tabular data. This method is a member of the *additive feature attribution methods* class; feature attribution refers to the fact that the change of an outcome to be explained (e.g., a class probability in a classification problem) with respect to a *baseline* (e.g., average prediction probability for that class in the training set) can be attributed in different proportions to the model input features. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple illustration of the explanation process is shown in Figure 1. Here we see depicted a model which takes as an input features such as `Age`, `BMI` or `Sex` and outputs a continuous value. We know that the average value of that output in a dataset of interest is `0.1`. Using the Kernel SHAP algorithm, we attribute the `0.3` difference to the input features. Because the sum of the attribute values equals `output - base rate`, this method is _additive_. We can see for example that the `Sex` feature contributes negatively to this prediction whereas the remainder of the features have a positive contribution. For explaining this particular data point, the `Age` feature seems to be the most important. See our examples on how to perform explanations with this algorithm and visualise the results using the `shap` library visualisations [here](../examples/kernel_shap_wine_intro.ipynb), [here](../examples/kernel_shap_wine_lr.ipynb) and [here](../examples/kernel_shap_adult_lr.ipynb)."

    "In order to compute the shap values , the following hyperparameters can be set when calling the `explain` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `nsamples`: Determines the number of subsets used for the estimation of the shap values. A default of `2*M + 2**11` is provided where `M` is the number of features. One is encouraged to experiment with the number of samples in order to determine a value that balances explanation accuracy and runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `l1_reg`: can take values `0`, `False` to disable, `auto` for automatic regularisation selection, `bic` or `aic` to use $\\ell_1$ regularised regression  with the Bayes/Akaike information criteria for regularisation parameter selection, `num_features(10)` to specify the number of feature effects to be returned or a float value that is used as the regularisation coefficient for the $\\ell_1$ penalised regression. The default option `auto` uses the least angle regression algorithm with the Akaike Information Criterion if a fraction smaller than `0.2` of the total number of subsets is enumerated.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset to be explained contains categorical variables, then the following options can be specified _unless_ the categorical variables have been grouped (see example below):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `summarise_result`: if True, the shap values estimated for dimensions of an encoded categorical variable are summed and a single shap value is returned for the categorical variable. This requires that both arguments below are specified:\n",
    "* `cat_var_start_idx`: a list containing the column indices where categorical variables start. For example if the  feature matrix contains a categorical feature starting at index `0` and one at index `10`, then `cat_var_start_idx=[0, 10]`.\n",
    "* `cat_vars_enc_dim`: a list containing the dimension of the encoded categorical variables. The number of columns specified in this list is summed for each categorical variable starting with the corresponding index in `cat_var_start_idx`. So if `cat_var_start_idx=[0, 10]` and `cat_vars_enc_dim=[3, 5]`, then the columns with indices `0, 1` and `2` and `10, 11, 12, 13` and `14` will be combined to return one shap value for each categorical variable, as opposed to `3` and `5`."
